This is the primitive version of the NMF algorithm with just 20 topics and gives most used words of the related topic according to the sample. 

This code was written just understand to how the NMF works.

In the future commitment, topic numbers and accuracy of the algorithm will be improved.

Edit : the NMF algorithm with 40 topics was added, nmf_40topic.ipynb file shows an example how to algorithm works, and Nfm_ready_to_use.ipynb is file that ready to implement our project.
