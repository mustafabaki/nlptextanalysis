and be recently demote due to insubordination but somehow be on    term with every cop uniform or otherwise in the city when the film be focus on saunder as  mostly be  feel like a straight recreation of a traumatic event that occur less than four year ago berg largely do well to avoid sensationalize the   bombing which kill   and wound   other and the subsequent manhunt that claim the life of a police officer at no point do patriot day feel like a glitzy action movie or a gory piece of horror the violence of that day be not linger on outside of an effort to make  victim feel like real people by depict snippet of  life beforehand wahlberg for  part can not help but make saunder feel like a bit of a stereotype  ’ a      movie cop in a film that ’ otherwise seek nuance saunder  seem be suppose to stand in for the generally lovable belligerent boston spirit that prevail in the day after the marathon and berg drill that point home far too many time there be bit that work —   in the
