This algorithm is Pachinko Allocation Model which returns 5 topics with 5 sub-topics for each topic with their probabilities for given English text.
Unfortunately it can't work with based on trained model because of Tomotopy library, so it has to be trained for every time.
In future, Lemmatizer and n-grams will be added.
